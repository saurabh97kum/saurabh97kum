# 👋 Hi, I'm Saurabh Kumar

I'm a theoretical physics PhD transitioning into data science and machine learning. With a strong background in mathematical modeling and analytical thinking, I’m passionate about using data to solve real-world problems and currently building hands-on skills in the field.

## 💡 What I’ve Learned & Next Steps

I have completed the following courses and certifications, which have helped me build a solid foundation:

- [Python (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/certification/saurabhkumar97/python)  
- [Pandas (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/certification/saurabhkumar97/pandas)  
- [Intro to SQL (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/certification/saurabhkumar97/intro-to-sql)  
- [Advanced SQL (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/certification/saurabhkumar97/advanced-sql)  
- [Machine Learning Specialization (Coursera)](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/verify/XR33PD2FNYK0)  
- [Advanced Learning Algorithms (Coursera)](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/verify/EA59HS4TKZH8)  

Through these courses, I’ve gained strong foundations in:

- Python programming and data manipulation with Pandas  
- Writing efficient SQL queries and database management  
- Building and tuning machine learning models with TensorFlow and scikit-learn  
- Understanding deep learning architectures like CNNs and optimization techniques  

I'm excited to deepen my skills by working on real-world projects such as:

- Image classification and model interpretability  
- Deploying ML models as web apps using Streamlit or Flask  
- Experimenting with transfer learning and advanced architectures  
- Exploring natural language processing and time series analysis
